## Security and Compliance Approach

### Security-by-Design
Security is embedded at every layer of the proposed architecture. AstraNova worked closely with **Daniel Foster (Information Security Officer)** to align security controls with NPSA governance requirements.

### Core Security Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least-privilege identity management
- Secure secrets storage and rotation
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Centralized logging and monitoring

### Compliance Alignment
The solution supports compliance through:
- Standardized configuration baselines
- Continuous security monitoring
- Documented controls and audit trails

This approach ensures NPSA can meet regulatory obligations without compromising delivery speed or system performance.
