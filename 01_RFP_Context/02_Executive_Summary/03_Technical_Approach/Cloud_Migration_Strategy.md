## Cloud Migration Strategy

### Overview
AstraNova proposes a structured, phased migration approach to transition NPSA applications from on-premise environments to the cloud while maintaining service continuity.

The migration strategy was developed in collaboration with **Rajesh Iyer (Lead Cloud Architect)** and aligns with NPSA’s operational priorities and risk tolerance.

### Migration Phases
1. **Discovery & Assessment**
   - Application inventory and dependency mapping
   - Readiness assessment across infrastructure, security, and data
   - Migration classification using the 6R framework

2. **Pilot & Foundation Setup**
   - Establishment of secure cloud landing zones
   - Network, identity, and access configuration
   - Migration of low-risk pilot applications

3. **Scaled Migration & Modernization**
   - Phased migration of core systems
   - Refactoring where appropriate to leverage cloud-native services
   - Decommissioning of legacy infrastructure

4. **Optimization & Stabilization**
   - Performance tuning
   - Cost optimization
   - Operational handover and documentation

### Key Benefits
- Reduced infrastructure risk
- Improved scalability and resilience
- Predictable, well-governed migration execution
