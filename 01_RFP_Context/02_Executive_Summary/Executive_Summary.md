## Executive Summary

This proposal is submitted by our esteemed customer AstraNova Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in response to the NorthRiver Public Services Authority (NPSA) initiative to modernize its legacy application landscape under Project ORION (Operational Resilience through Integrated Optimization & Networking).

NPSA currently operates a portfolio of mission-critical systems hosted on aging on-premise infrastructure. These systems present challenges related to scalability, security, deployment speed, and operational resilience. AstraNova proposes a phased cloud modernization strategy leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the primary platform, with Microsoft Azure supporting disaster recovery and continuity requirements.

Our approach emphasizes security-by-design, automation-driven delivery, and clear governance. Working closely with NPSA stakeholders, including Michael R. Lawson (CIO) and Dr. Elaine Carter (Director of Digital Transformation), the solution is designed to minimize operational risk while enabling long-term agility.

By integrating modern DevSecOps practices, standardized cloud architectures, and compliance-aligned security controls, AstraNova will help NPSA achieve improved system reliability, faster release cycles, and a stronger security posture. This proposal reflects a practical, mission-focused modernization strategy built on proven delivery methods and clear documentation.
